## Project

### Use TDD to build a Todo app

The aim for the next couple of days is to build a basic todo list app. This file will help you get started and give you an introduction to unit testing and tdd for client side code.

This project is split into three parts:
  * the first part should be done tdd, here you will create the logic needed to modify your list, and will not interact with the DOM. Use qunit to do this. create an extra file called test
  * the second part involves rendering the todo list to the dom;
  * the third part involves adding your own features.

Some things you might want to add for the third part
  * edit todo text
  * style using css
  * remove the mark button and listen for clicks on the whole todo item.

Todo:
  * read through the file todo.js. Do not worry if it does not all makes sense at first.
  * set up a new repo for your project this week.
  * copy and commit the files inside skeleton folder into your repository. **warning** only one person in you time should do this, then everyone else can pull down
  * set up a qunit testing environment in a file called test.html. This will be similar to what you have done before and will need to link in the todo.js file.
  * Using tdd, complete the first part of the exercise.
  * complete the functions createTodoNode and the addTodoForm onsubmit
  * add some style.
  * now feel free to experiment and add features!
