Build a stopwatch!

**Project brief:**
- Split into your groups of 4, then pair up within that group (1 stopwatch per pair).
- Follow the TDD cycle to create a stopwatch, using ping pong.
- Before you go off and start building your stopwatch, you may want to spend couple of hours on a Technical Spike.
  - This will put you in good stead when it comes to building the stopwatch in a TDD manner.

**Stopwatch specs:**
- Start buttom
- Stop button
- Reset button
- display hours, seconds, minutes and milliseconds

**Stretch goals:**
- laps
- countdown timer
- split timer
- use BlanketJS for code coverage (Extra points for 100% code coverage!!! :wink:)
- add as much functionality as you like! (alarm, translator, speed up/slow down etc.)

**For the purpose of your learning:**
- Focus on functionality, TDD and a full set of tests before CSS.
- TDD can be painful and slow but it's a key learning objective for this week, persevere.
